📧 Email Categorizer & Backup System
The Email Categorizer & Backup System is a smart Python-based project designed to streamline and secure your email management process. This tool utilizes Machine Learning techniques—specifically Naive Bayes Classification with TF-IDF Vectorization—to automatically categorize incoming emails into various types (e.g., Work, Personal, Promotions, etc.).

Beyond categorization, the system ensures that every email is safely backed up in both a raw format and a structured Excel sheet, allowing for easy access, organization, and future reference.
